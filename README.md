# SQL-Zoo
Today I was brushing up on some SQL, as it has been a bit since I looked at it, and I wanted to challange myself. I love SQL so this was really fun. I went to SQL Zoo and found The World Dataset. I had to choose this one to play with as I am a geography nerd so it was calling to me. I tried out the first few challanges and I was zipping right along. So, I skipped to the end to really try and challange myself. After, a few small errors I was able to get the answer that I needed to solve the problem. 

The moral of this story is to keep practicing your skills. It takes a good bit of effort to learn but we can forget what we learn pretty quickly when we stop using our skills or start going in a different direction. I would challange you to try different programming challanges on a regular basis maybe every few months to stay current on your skills. Plus it's always fun to challange yourself. 

For those of you that stayed this long and are interested in the SQL Zoo Challange here is the link: https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial
