#This is a simple SQL Query that will answer the question for the SQL Zoo World Challange.
#Here is the question that lead to this code: 

#Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.
#Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.

#You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
#The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'

SELECT name
   FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%'
AND name LIKE '%e%'
AND name LIKE '%i%'
AND name LIKE '%o%'
AND name LIKE '%u%'
AND name NOT LIKE "% %"
